This ASU FSE100 Final Project involves using Matlab to move a car made from a Lego EV3 Kit autonomously. Specifically, the car would pick up a miniature of a passenger and go through a maze to the end while stopping at specific colored tiles (like stopping at red). This project aims to imitate a rideshare service for the elderly and disabled.

As of 11/18/24, the project is currently a work in progress. This was worked by a team of four.
