This ASU FSE100 Final Project involves using Matlab to remotely and autonomously move a car made from a Lego EV3 Kit. Specifically, the car would pick up a miniature of a passenger and go through a maze to the end while stopping at specific colored tiles (like stopping at red). This project aims to imitate a rideshare service for the elderly and disabled.

As of 11/18/24, the project is currently a work in progress. This was worked by a team of four.

# EV3 Files
Needed in order for MATLAB to access the EV3 methods. Simply add to MATLAB folder, and in MATLAB:
  1) Right-Click on the Folder
  2) Add to Path > Selected Folders and Subfolders

# testScriptForCar.m
The actual code for the movement of the EV3 Car (includes both remote control with W/A/S/D, Space to stop, and "q" to switch to auto movement).
