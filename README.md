This ASU FSE100 Final Project involves using Matlab to autonomously move a car made from a Lego EV3 Kit. Specifically, the car would pick up a miniature of a passenger and go through a maze to the end while stopping at red tiles (just like stopping at a red light). This project aims to imitate a rideshare service for the elderly and disabled.

As of 10/30/24, the project is currently a work in progress. This was worked by a team of four.
